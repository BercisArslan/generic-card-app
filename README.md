# generic-card-app
II1305 Project in Information and Communication Technology

Welcome to the generic-card-app!

We are a group of 8 students from The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) that currently are 
taking the course "Project in Informations and Communication Technology". 
During 4 weeks our goal is to create a generic card app for both IOS and Android in React Native. 

This card application is different from other card games since the point of this application
is that you can use it when you do not have a real deck of cards. 
The goal is to make it possible to play the card game of your own choice so
you can make your own rules, just as in real life.

Participants: Bercis Arslan, Behnam Eliasi, 
Amanda Tudose Fuentes, Daniel Kangyoun Cho, 
Karolina Barrios, Max Gustaf Sutton Wandin, 
Kevin Ammouri, Martin Brisfors
